Optimizing visual estimation of peanut late leaf spot severity with online training sessions and standard area diagrams

Quantification of plant disease severity is key for plant pathology research, particularly in the evaluation of disease control measures. 
Visual estimation of severity remains widely used, especially in the field. Training sessions and the use of standard area diagram sets 
(SADs) are known to enhance rater accuracy. We aimed to quantify and compare the benefits of these tools, either used alone or in combination,
when visually assessing peanut late leaf spot severity. We designed and validated SADs to aid in disease severity estimation and also 
evaluated the training tool TraineR2, a web-based app that contains actual images of the disease with known severity. In this repository are the R-codes
using in the data analysis.
